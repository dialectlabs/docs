# Introduction

:::info  Unified Feed Now Available!
Our latest update introduces the [Unified Feed](./unified-feed.md) feature, allowing users to receive notifications from multiple applications in a single feed. This brings a more streamlined experience for your users and enables wallet integrations to display all notifications in one place.
:::

Dialect Alerts is a smart messaging protocol for dApp notifications and wallet-to-wallet chat. We are powering notifications and messaging for over 30 of the most-loved dApps and wallets on Solana, EVM, and Aptos.

All of our tooling is open source and free to use. Our on-chain messaging protocol, `v0`, is live and audited on mainnet. We offer a host of off-chain tooling and services as well, including a multi-chain messaging protocol, `v1`, and a set of tools around powering notifications for dapps.

## How to use this documentation

This documentation is meant for developers who wish to integrate Dialect into their dApps or wallets for messaging and notifications. All our tooling is available on our [Github](https://github.com/dialectlabs), and this documentation will guide you through the relevant repositories.\
