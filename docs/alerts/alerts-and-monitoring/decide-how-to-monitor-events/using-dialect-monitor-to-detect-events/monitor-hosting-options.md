# Monitor Hosting Options

Now that you have learned to implement a Dialect Monitor to detect and programmatically send notifications to your subscribers, you will need to host that monitor within a service.

If you already have a preferred infrastructure/framework for hosting services, you can simply choose to host and manage your Monitor that way, and you can skip directly to this section to setup your UI/UX experience for users:

[advancing-react-notifications](../../advancing-react-notifications/)

Otherwise, Dialect offers an opinionated, standardized way of hosting a Monitor within a Dialect Monitoring Service (Nest.js server implementation).

If you would like to use this opinionated hosting option, continue forward.
