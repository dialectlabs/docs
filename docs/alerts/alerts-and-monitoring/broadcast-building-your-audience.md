# Broadcast: Building Your Audience

<img src="/img/blog post-Web3 Needs an Alerts Stack.png" alt=""/>

Many dapps wish to send product updates, community announcements, and other manually-crafted notifications to their users. Dialect offers an administrator dashboard for sending these announcements. Dapp administrators can connect to the dashboard [here](https://dashboard.dialect.to/) using your dapp's messaging keypair that you created in the [Registering Your Dapp](registering-your-dapp.md) section to use these incredible community building features!
