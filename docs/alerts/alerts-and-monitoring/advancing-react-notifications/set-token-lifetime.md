# Set Token Lifetime

The token is your user's key to interact with their data - they need it to fetch their feed, subscribe to new alerts or change settings. You can set how long your refresh token should be valid. For security reasons, we recommend a maximum expiration date of three months.

## Token Expiration Basics

:::tip
If you don't want your tokens to expire, you can set the expiration time to a higher limit, e.g., 100 years: `tokenLifetimeMinutes: 100 * 365 * 24 * 60`
:::

- **Default expiration**: 24 hours
- **Recommended maximum**: 3 months
- **Configuration**: Set via `tokenLifetimeMinutes` in your config object

## Why do tokens expire?

Since your users are fetching sensitive data, it's important to protect them and their privacy. Token expiration is a simple yet effective security measure â€“ like regularly changing your wifi password.

## What happens after the token expires?

If the token expires:

- Your users will still receive all the notifications they signed up for.
- A new signed message is required to authenticate again.
- After authentication, users can access their feed and change settings.

## Usage

You can set the token lifetime in the `DialectSolanaSdk` config.

```typescript {16-21}
import "@dialectlabs/react-ui/index.css";

import { DialectSolanaSdk } from "@dialectlabs/react-sdk-blockchain-solana";
import {
  Icons,
  NotificationTypeStyles,
  NotificationsButton,
} from "@dialectlabs/react-ui";

const DAPP_ADDRESS = "...";

export const DialectSolanaNotificationsButton = () => {
  return (
    <DialectSolanaSdk
      dappAddress={DAPP_ADDRESS}
      config={{
        dialectCloud: {
          tokenStore: "local-storage",
          tokenLifetimeMinutes: 3 * 30 * 24 * 60, // 3 months (recommended)
        },
      }}
    >
      <NotificationsButton />
    </DialectSolanaSdk>
  );
};
```
