# Push Notifications

Push notifications are an effective way to engage your users about important events, even when they're not actively using your application. As a part of Dialect's Alerts Stack, we offer a push notification API that lets you

1. [Send](./send-push-notifications.md) push notifications from your backend, and
2. give your users the ability to opt into, and [receive](./receive-push-notifications.md), push notifications from you.

Dialect's push notification API is built on top of Firebase Messaging Cloud and provides all the same performance guarantees. It also includes a number of benefits on top of Firebase that are part of our broader Alerts Stack: this API handles all the complexities of token management, device tracking, and notification delivery, allowing you to focus on creating valuable notification content for your users.

This section is divided into two sub-sections:

1. [Receive notifications](receive-push-notifications.md) — A set of APIs to build out the notification opt-in and congfiguration flows in your client app for your users.
2. [Send notifications](./send-push-notifications.md) — A set of APIs to send notifications to your users from your backend.
