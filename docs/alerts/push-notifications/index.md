# Push Notifications

Push notifications are an effective way to notify your users by delivering timely updates and information directly to their devices, even when they're not actively using your application. Dialect's Push Notification API enables you to seamlessly integrate this capability into your applications.

## Key Benefits

- **Immediate Delivery:** Reach users instantly with important information
- **Wallet-Based Authentication:** Securely associate notifications with specific Solana wallets
- **User Control:** Allow users to manage their notification preferences

## How It Works

1. Authentication: Users authenticate with their Solana wallet through a simple message signing process.
2. Subscribe to Notifications: After authentication, your application registers the user's device to receive push notifications.
3. Receive Notifications: From now on, the user will be notified about relevant events directly on their device, even when they're not actively using your application.

The API handles all the complexities of token management, device tracking, and notification delivery, allowing you to focus on creating valuable notification content for your users.
