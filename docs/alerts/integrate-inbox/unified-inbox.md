# Unified Inbox

The Unified Inbox represents the next evolution of messaging, transforming isolated app notifications into a shared, user-controlled communication layer across the entire ecosystem.

## What is a Unified Inbox?

Traditionally, each application maintains its own dedicated inbox for users. When you use Drift, you receive Drift notifications. When you use Bonk, you get Bonk alerts. Each app operates in isolation, creating fragmented communication experiences.

The Unified Inbox breaks down these silos by creating a **shared notification feed** where users can opt-in to receive messages from multiple applications they care about. Instead of checking separate inboxes across different apps, users have one central place to see all their notifications.

## How It Works

The Unified Inbox builds directly on Dialect's existing notification infrastructure:

    end

```

### Core Concepts

**Cross-App Subscriptions**: Users can subscribe to notifications from any registered Dialect app, not just the one they're currently using. A user in your DeFi app could also receive liquidation alerts from Drift and governance updates from their favorite DAO.

**User-Controlled**: Users have complete control over which apps they want to hear from and through which channels (push, email, in-app). They can subscribe to Bonk community updates via push notifications while receiving Sanctum staking rewards only in-app.

**Shared Infrastructure**: All apps use the same Dialect messaging infrastructure, making cross-app communication seamless. The same APIs that power your app's notifications can deliver messages from any other registered app.

## Building on Existing Infrastructure

The Unified Inbox doesn't require new APIs or endpoints‚Äîit leverages the notification system you're already familiar with:

### App Discovery & Subscription

Users discover and subscribe to apps using the existing app management endpoints:

- **[GET /v2/apps](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/GET/v2/apps)**: Lists all available apps users can subscribe to
- **[POST /v2/subscribe](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/POST/v2/subscribe)**: Subscribe to notifications from specific apps
- **[POST /v2/unsubscribe](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/POST/v2/unsubscribe)**: Unsubscribe from app notifications

For implementation details, see the [User Management](./user-management.md) documentation.

### Unified Message History

The notification history endpoints automatically aggregate messages from all subscribed apps:

- **[GET /v2/history](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/GET/v2/history)**: Retrieves unified message history across all subscribed apps
- **[GET /v2/history/summary](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/GET/v2/history/summary)**: Gets unread counts and latest messages
- **[POST /v2/history/read](https://alerts-api.dial.to/docs#tag/subscriber/POST/v2/history/read)**: Marks messages as read

For implementation details, see the [Notifications](./api/notifications.md) documentation.

### Cross-Channel Delivery

Messages from all subscribed apps are delivered through the user's preferred channels:

- **Push Notifications**: Mobile alerts from any subscribed app
- **Email**: Digest emails with updates from multiple apps  
- **In-App**: Unified notification feed within your application

For implementation details, see the [Push Notifications](./api/push-notifications.md) documentation.

## User Experience Benefits

### For Users
- **Single Source of Truth**: One inbox for all notifications instead of scattered app-specific feeds
- **Reduced Context Switching**: No need to check multiple apps for important updates
- **Granular Control**: Choose exactly which apps to hear from and how
- **Consistent Experience**: Familiar notification patterns across all apps

### For Developers
- **Increased Engagement**: Users can discover and engage with your app through the unified feed
- **Network Effects**: Benefit from the broader Dialect ecosystem of apps and users
- **Reduced Development**: Leverage existing notification infrastructure instead of building from scratch
- **Cross-App Integration**: Enable users to stay connected with your app even when using others

## Implementation Strategy

To support the Unified Inbox in your application:

### 1. App Registration
Ensure your app is properly registered with Dialect so users can discover and subscribe to it. See the [App Registration guide](../setup/register-app.md).

### 2. User Authentication  
Implement the authentication flow so users can manage their cross-app subscriptions. See the [Authentication documentation](./api/authentication.md).

### 3. Subscription Management
Build UI that allows users to:
- Browse available apps using the `/v2/apps` endpoint
- Subscribe/unsubscribe from apps they're interested in
- Manage notification preferences per app

### 4. Unified Feed Display
Create a notification feed that shows messages from all subscribed apps:
- Use `/v2/history` to fetch the unified message stream
- Display app branding/icons to show message sources
- Implement filtering options (by app, by type, etc.)

### 5. Cross-App Actions
Consider implementing actions that work across apps:
- "Subscribe to similar apps" recommendations
- Cross-app notification batching
- Unified notification settings

## Real-World Examples

**DeFi Power User**: A trader subscribed to Drift (liquidation alerts), Jupiter (swap confirmations), and Sanctum (staking rewards) sees all updates in one feed while trading on any platform.

**Community Member**: A Solana enthusiast subscribed to Bonk (community updates), Magic Eden (NFT drops), and Dialect (platform updates) gets a comprehensive view of ecosystem activity.

**Portfolio Manager**: An investor subscribed to multiple yield farming protocols gets consolidated alerts about position changes, rewards, and opportunities across their entire portfolio.


## Getting Started

Ready to support the Unified Inbox? Start with these resources:

1. **[Authentication](./api/authentication.md)** - Set up user authentication for subscription management
2. **[User Management](./user-management.md)** - Implement app discovery and subscription flows  
3. **[Notifications](./api/notifications.md)** - Build the unified message feed
