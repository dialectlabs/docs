# Receive a notificaiton
This is how you can receive an alert. First step is that you have to authenticate.

## Authentication

Before you can receive alerts, you need to authenticate using one of the following methods:

### Solana Wallet Authentication (Message Signing)
 
The most common method for wallet authentication using message signing:

1. **[Prepare Authentication Message](../../api/alerts/post-v-2-auth-solana-prepare)** - Get a message to sign
2. **[Verify Signed Message](../../api/alerts/post-v-2-auth-solana-verify)** - Submit the signed message to complete authentication

### Solana Wallet Authentication (Transaction Signing)

Alternative method using transaction signing:

1. **[Prepare Authentication Transaction](../../api/alerts/post-v-2-auth-solana-tx-prepare)** - Get a transaction to sign
2. **[Verify Signed Transaction](../../api/alerts/post-v-2-auth-solana-tx-verify)** - Submit the signed transaction to complete authentication

### Check Authentication Status

Once authenticated, you can verify your current authentication status:

- **[Get Current User](../../api/alerts/get-v-2-auth)** - Returns the currently authenticated user based on session data

All these endpoints are part of the **Subscriber** authentication flow and require a valid `X-Dialect-Client-Key` header for client identification.
