# Advanced use cases

This section is dedicated to advanced `Blink` use cases and functionalities that go beyond the basics of blink integration. As we continue to innovate and expand the capabilities of blinks, be sure to revisit this section regularly to stay up-to-date with the latest features and enhancements.

Our team is constantly working on adding new functionalities and improving the blink experience for both developers and end-users. From complex workflows using [action chaining](./action-chaining.md) to multi-chain support, we strive to provide a powerful and flexible solution for integrating blockchain experiences into your applications.

## Guides

In addition to the documentation provided here, we also offer a collection of [hands-on guides](../guides/index.md) that showcase real-world examples and implementations. These guides are an excellent resource for developers looking to dive deeper into the advanced features of blinks and learn best practices for integrating them into their projects.
