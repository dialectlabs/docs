# Blinks Provider (Backend)

Blinks are distributable experiences that can be embedded anywhere a link can exist. They represent a modern alternative to traditional SDKs, offering a streamlined, maintainable way to expose your services to the world.

As a blink provider, your backend is the engine that powers these experiences, delivering functionality to clients and integrations effortlessly.

The Blinks Provider ecosystem equips you with the tools and infrastructure to create, manage, and serve blinks from your backend, ensuring they’re reliable, scalable, and easy to distribute.

## Key Benefits

Think of your blink providers as hosted endpoints, that you provide for devs to easily integrate with your service using nothing but an URL.

- **Rapid Adoption**: Enable other developers to integrate your service in seconds by sharing a simple link, while you retain full control over the blink's behavior.
- **Consistent Delivery**: Guarantee that your service's logic and design principles are enforced across all implementations, no matter where your blink is used.
- **Seamless Updates**: Update your blink's functionality or UI once on your backend, and see changes reflected instantly everywhere it's embedded—no SDK versioning required.
