# Monad Scaffold

Blink scaffold Monad acts as a downloadable and reusable template that utilizes `NextJS` and `Tailwind` as the front end framework plus API routes for the backend. It comes with all necessary dependencies and configuration out of the box, so that you can immediately start building.

To install the scaffold, all you have to do is to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dialectlabs/blink-starter-monad.git
```

#### Setup

Install the dependencies

```shell
cd blink-starter-monad && npm install
```

#### Set RPC URL 

By default, we use the Monad testnet RPC in our examples. If you have your own RPC, please update it in the `.env`-file. If you add your private RPC, don't forget to add the `.env` to your `.gitignore`.

Update the RPC url

```
# file: .env

# Fill in the URL of your Monad RPC (optional)

NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz
```

### Run on localhost

Run the following command in your terminal

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. Please be reminded that the port 3000 could also be a different port. It is recommended to check the port in your terminal.
