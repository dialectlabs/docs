# UI Components

Integrating blinks into your existing applications is made simple with Dialect's pre-built UI components. Built using our [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dialectlabs/blinks) and [React-Native SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dialectlabs/blinks-react-native), these components can be customized to seamlessly match your application's design and user experience.

## Key benefits

Using our UI components is the recommended way to integrate blinks for several reasons:

- **Simplified Integration**: Our components handle all the complexities of rendering, unfurling, and user interactions, allowing you to integrate blinks with minimal code.
- **Consistent Experience**: Ensure your blinks are displayed and function consistently across your application, maintaining a cohesive user experience.
- **Customization Options**: While our components work great out of the box, they also offer customization options to match your application's unique design.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: By using our UI components, you benefit from continuous updates and improvements made to the Dialect platform.
