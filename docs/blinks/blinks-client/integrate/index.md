# Integrate

In this section you will learn how you can integrate your own blinks or the blinks that have been already build into your existing services so that you can deliver any blockchain experience right to your user in almost no time.

There are mostly two paths that you can use to integrate blinks: [Headless](./headless/index.md) and [UI Components](./ui-components/index.md).

It is strongly recommended to always use our client SDKs, when you decide to integrate blinks, because they cut your development time by almost 99 % and ensure that your blinks are provided in the best way possible.
